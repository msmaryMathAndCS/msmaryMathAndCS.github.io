  <center><h3>Who are Women in Computing</h3></center>
    <p>Any student or campus faculty who strive to support and promote women in computing fields, which includes both technology and mathematics, are able to join and attend meetings which are published on their Teams page. Events are also sent out through emails for anyone that wants to attend. There is no formal membership required, anyone can join anytime.  
    </p>
  

  <center><h3>Facts and things to consider</h3></center>
    <p>The Women in Computing community has been around for a long time. It’s a casual way to support women in technology and math fields but is not exclusive to women as anyone can participate and support. Oftentimes they will provide snacks or special treats during their events. 
    </p>


  <center><h3>What is the purpose of Women in Computing</h3></center>
    <p>The purpose of WIC is to build a community among women in technology and math majors or those who have general interest in the subject. The general goal is to create a network of people who support women throughout their journey in the Mount or any future workplaces in order to help them academically improve towards their career. 
    </p>

  <center><h3>Types of Events</h3></center>
	<p>They provide a healthy mix of leisure and social events as well as incorporating events that are more academically helpful.</p>
	<p>Some of the events that they have hosted in the past include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Game and Movie nights, where people can relax and socialize 
    </li>
    <li>Resume Workshops, where people can bring in their resumes and have a professor or other professionals go over the resume with the student</li>
    <li>Career Panels, in which outside professionals will join via zoom and talk about their career as a woman in the technology or math industry</li>
  </ul>

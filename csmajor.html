                      <i>
                      The purpose of a computer science major 
                      extends beyond learning to program and code. 
                      Computer scientists design, develop, and 
                      analyze software and hardware to solve 
                      problems in business, industry, science, 
                      and society. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Computer science has a 
                      significant human component since computers 
                      serve and enrich people's lives. This major 
                      strengthens critical thinking and problem-solving 
                      skills, equipping students with valuable abilities 
                      such as analytical and logical thinking, technical 
                      and mathematical proficiency, attention to detail, 
                      project management, technical writing, research, 
                      and even art and design.

                      To complete their degree, computer science students take various courses, 
                      culminating in Capstone 1 and Capstone 2. During these courses, students work 
                      on significant projects, collaborating with clients or selecting topics from on-campus or 
                      external sources.

                      Capstone 2 focuses on detailed design, and students also discuss computer ethics.
                      At the end of their studies, students present their projects at the university's SPARK event. 
                      Faculty, peers, and industry professionals evaluate and research significant projects in this sizable on-campus showcase. 
                      Every computer science student participates in this event before graduating.

                      <i>
                        Pursuing a computer science degree is more than a career choice—it is a 
                        lifelong commitment to continuous learning and skill development. The field constantly evolves, 
                        requiring professionals to keep pace with technological advancements.

                        <br>
                        Succeeding in computer science demands persistence, especially when facing complex concepts. 
                        There will be times when classroom material is challenging to grasp, but it is up to students to fill 
                        those knowledge gaps. Additionally, making mistakes is part of the learning process. Growth in this field comes 
                        from trial and error, not perfection. Artificial intelligence cannot teach these skills—only hands-on practice and perseverance can. 
                        That is the essence of computer science.

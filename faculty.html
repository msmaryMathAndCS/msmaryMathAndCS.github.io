  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>To ensure the teaching of computer science, cybersecurity, data-science, and math-related fields and curriculum is in accordance with Mount St. Mary's University's policies.</p>
    <p>Some professors have degrees, experience and teach in mutiple area of focus while others specialize in one specific branch of technology.</p>

    <hr>

  <h3>Further Details</h3>
    <p>
      Each faculty members joins by speaking with the head of the department and completing a series of interviews. 
      Meetings are scheduled monthly for faculty, sometimes to discuss policies and others for assistance with research. 
      There is constant collaborations between both faculty and students (clubs, internships, conferences, research, etc.). 
      Students also have the chance to apply for scholarships and fellowships programs, with the assistance of professors from both an academic and professional standpoint.

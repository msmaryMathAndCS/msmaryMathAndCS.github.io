                <h3>What is Mount Programming Club?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Mount Programming Club (MPC) provides several opportunities for students to meet with one another and discuss
                    computer science topics. Each club meeting is centered around a new concept to enable students to receive a
                    wide variety of the differing realms of the field. The club originally began in October of 2023, with the original
                    leaders graduating in May of 2024. The MPC is still an active part of the Mount community, providing
                    great opportunities to students and allowing them to learn more about computer science in general.

                <h3>Who participates in MPC?</h3>
                <p>
                  Any Mount student that is interested in learning more about computer
                  science and wishes to take part in different programming challenges is
                  welcome to join the club. It is also open to all grade levels.
                  Participation varies from meeting to meeting, but there are currently
                  fifteen students involved with the club consistently. Other members of
                  the organization that attend less frequently add the total up to around
                  thirty people altogether.

                <h3>How to Join?</h3>
                <p>
                  Students are able to join the activity by simply showing up to one of their events.
                  Signs and flyers are posted on TV screens within the COAD science building.
                  There are also emails sent to Mount students frequently when an event is upcoming.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Information Regarding Participation?</h3>
                <p>
                  Students should be prepared to face difficult challenges at times and be willing to
                  ask others for assistance when necessary. Students should therefore be willing to
                  help other participants when they are stuck and in need of help with some recommendations
                  on how to proceed and complete the challenges successfully. It is important to note that
                  students who are members of the club enter with a variety of different experience
                  levels, so everyone must work together as a community to help others when confused.

                <h3>MPC Events:</h3>
                <p>
                  The organization sponsors a wide range of activities that they organize over the course
                  of the academic year. Each event focuses on a different aspect of the main goal of the
                  organization, getting students interested in learning more about the different kinds of
                  programming and its history along with other aspects of computer science overall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are games such jeopardy and Clash of Code challenges. Clash of Code is an outside source
                  that creates coding games and competitions to get others familiar with programming.
                  The club also prepares for computer science competitions and attends them to compete
                  against other teams and each other for the chance to win. Finally, there are small
                  challenges to partake in that are created by the student leaders in order to discuss new and exciting topics and  
                  opportunities for students. For example, decrypting a text file was a more recent activity that was hosted by the club in the spring of 2025.

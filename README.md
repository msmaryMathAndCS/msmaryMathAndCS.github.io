## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

### Faculty


### Computer Science major 

The **Computer Science B.S.** webpage is designed to provide prospective students with valuable information regarding the major, its academic requirements, and career prospects. We gathered credible insights from sources such as [MichiganTech.com](https://www.michigantech.com), [BestSchools.com](https://www.bestschools.com), and [Mount St. Mary's University's Computer Science Page](https://www.msmu.edu). Additionally, **Dr. Lamprecht** shared an interesting fact about a former professor who built a personal computer that Mount faculty still maintain today, adding a historical and practical perspective to the major.

**Structure and Content**

We aimed to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly webpage by including the following sections:

- **Academic Requirements**: Clear guidelines on the courses and skills needed to complete the major.
- **Career Prospects**: A focus on potential job opportunities and career pathways after graduation.
- **Personal Insights**: We shared our experiences as current computer science students, offering advice on strategies for success and expectations in the program.

**Layout and Design**

We implemented the following structure in our webpage:

- **HTML Structure**: We used HTML to organize content effectively. Key sections are introduced using header tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) to define topics clearly. Paragraph tags (`<p>`) were used to display the researched content. Horizontal rule tags (`<hr>`) help separate sections for clarity and easy navigation.

- **CSS Styling**: The webpage was styled with a **blue and pink color scheme**, selected to convey the complexity and sophistication of the Computer Science field. We linked an external CSS stylesheet in the `<head>` section of the HTML file, pulling styles from the central repository for consistent design. This color palette was intended to highlight important topics while maintaining a professional aesthetic.

**Functionality and User Experience**

Our layout is intentionally minimalistic, focused on keeping the user experience simple and direct. The design avoids unnecessary complexity while emphasizing the most relevant information. Additionally, we included **hyperlinks** to reputable external sources, offering users the opportunity to access further details on the topics covered.

**Key Takeaways**

- We structured the content to be easily navigable and visually appealing.
- The design balances professional aesthetics with user-friendly navigation.
- External sources are cited properly, with hyperlinks included for further exploration.

### Mathematics major

**Process**
We gathered our information from two sources, the first being the Overview for the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (https://catalog.msmary.edu/content.php?catoid=14&navoid=593), and the second being the page giving information about the various classes a Mathematics major may expect to take throughout their years at the university (https://catalog.msmary.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=1203&returnto=593). We decided that all the information we included in our site was important for someone looking to learn about the major to know. For the styling of our page we decided that we would present our information in a question and answer format. We started by asking an important question to give context about the major, then answering it in an informative manner so the reader learns all they need to know.

### Data Science Major Topic

Our page is about the Data Science Major here at Mount St. Mary's University. Our information was gathered from the university's catalog of majors, specifically the section on Data Science itself. This information was used to describe what the major itself is about and how it serves the student population and/or anyone that is interested in taking the major. We used most, if not all, of the information about the major that was offered by the university to put together our specific page and provide a detailed look into what the Data Science major has to offer here at the Mount.

The initial "Who oversees the Data Science program" section, includes information such as who teaches what classes and who heads the major, such as the dean and other administrators. This information was gathered from the Department of Math and CS page offered by the university.

"Who participates in Data Science Courses" includes the types of students that take the courses. These include data science majors, CS majors, and math majors, as outlined in this section of the page.

"What should one expect" from a Data Science course outlines what content the courses are about and includes different examples of the course workloads.

In order to outline data science post-college, the "What to expect after graduating as a Data Science major" section is next to show what can be done with the major. Applying a major after graduating from the university is one of the most important aspects.

"Notable Facts" concludes the Data Science page with a few other notes about the major.

All of these individual sections are followed with directions to sources.

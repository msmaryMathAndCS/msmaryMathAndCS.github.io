## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

## Coad Hubs
The Coad Hubs page provides information on the various collaborative spaces and student engagement opportunities within the Math and CS Department at Mount St. Mary's University. These hubs are designed to foster a supportive community for students to explore their academic interests, engage with faculty and peers, and participate in extracurricular activities related to the fields of Mathematics, Computer Science, and related disciplines.

### Information Sources:
Faculty Discussions: Insights were gathered from conversations with Dr. Lamprecht and other faculty members regarding the role of Coad Hubs in the department.

### Departmental Website: 
The official Math and CS Department website provided additional context about the hubs' purpose and historical development.

### Student Feedback: 
Testimonials and feedback from students who actively use the Coad Hubs contributed to the understanding of their practical impact and value.

### Information Included:
General Overview: A description of each hub within the Coad building, including its purpose and the types of activities it hosts (e.g., coding sessions, math discussions, group study, etc.).

### Hub Activities:
 A list of activities that regularly occur in the Coad Hubs, such as tutoring hours, student-led workshops, and informal study sessions.

### Student Engagement:
 Information about how students can get involved, including how to reserve space within the hubs for group projects or individual study.

### Future Plans:
 Plans for expanding or enhancing the Coad Hubs, including potential new resources, technological upgrades, or collaboration with other departments.

### Information Excluded:
Specific Schedules: Schedules for particular activities (like tutoring or workshops) were not included, as they may change each semester.

### Individual Student Testimonials:
 Personal anecdotes from students were not included for brevity, but general feedback was used to shape the content.

### Styling and Formatting Choices:
Two-Column Layout: A two-column format was chosen to clearly differentiate between the general description of the hubs and the activities offered. The left column is dedicated to the hub descriptions, while the right column lists current activities.

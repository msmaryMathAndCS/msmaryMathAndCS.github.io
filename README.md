## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

## Usage

Students in the Software Development class are required to participate in this project as part of their classwork. Other GitHub users not in the class may also contribute, but may be rejected. See the [GitHub Docs: Contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for more guidance on contributing to a project on GitHub.

### Students of color in STEM club

**Purpose**
To inform and attract people to the Students of Color in STEM club. The information chosen was from a select group of questions to highlight the purpose and importance of the club the answers were given by a member of the club and how it benefits the Mount's student body and accepting culture of everyone.

The information on the html page is used not only to inform but to advertise the club to anyone who is interested and willing to join. The Students of Color in STEM club was made to help people who may be undervalued have their STEM voice heard and amplified and engage in activities to help futher their carrer in STEM. The club is very impactful because it show's the Mount good character and how much they care about people who are underepresented in the STEM space.

**How data was collected**
How the information of the club is included in the club's page is we do a Q&A type of style where we present a question a lot of people may have about the club and show a detailed answer. Some specifics the page has is there are links to the Mount School of Science, Mathematics and Technology and at the bottom of the page I have information on who we got the answer's to our important questions from and a button to go to the top once you scroll all the way down.

**Design**
I put the school logo at the top of the webpage and above it I put the title of the club underneath the logo I put the Q&A style then underneath that I added information the source who we got the information from we choose this style because I felt like it was simple and easy to understand and very informative with the infromation included along with it being straight to the point.

This page was created with the CSS and HTML files provided in the repoistory by Dr. Lamprecht and the formatting is essientally the same style for the rest of the pages in the repository.

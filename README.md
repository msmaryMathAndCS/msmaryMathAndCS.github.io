## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### The Double Major
The double major page is a list of the double major options available to students. Most of the information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Clubs and organizations were gathered from the Mount's [P.E.A.K. page](https://msmary.presence.io/).  

The page was written using the HTML and CSS files included in the repository provided by Dr. Lamprecht. Therefore, the general styling and formatting of the page is consistent with the rest of the pages in the repository.   

In order to maintain symplicity in the design and formatting, the page is divided into titled sections. Most of the information on the page are displayed in bulletted lists. Captions provide the sources from which the information was gathered.

#### Page Contents
* Overview of the double major and options available to students in the CS and Math departments.
* Program Oversight
* Benefits of a double major
* How to declare a double major
* Related activities and events 
* Considerations for students considering a double major  

#### Page Limitations

Because this page covers the double major options available to students in the CS and Math departments, it is not a comprehensive list of all double major options available to students at the Mount. Furthermore, the page does not include in depth information on the requirements for a double major, as that information is available in the [Mount's Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php).  

However, in the future, the page may be expanded to include options and examples on the requirements and graduation pathways for double majors in the CS and Math departments. Similar to how the [Computer Science major page](https://github.com/Mount-St-Marys-University/Math-CS-Department/blob/main/Computer%20Science%20Major.md) includes information on the requirements for the major.  

Furthermore, more interactivity on the page may be added in the future. For example, a dropdown menu that allows users to select a double major option and see the requirements for that option. This would allow users to see the requirements for a double major without having to navigate to a separate page, making the page more interactive and user-friendly.  

The inclusion of images and/or diagrams may also be considered to enhance the visual appeal and understanding of the page.

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

## Usage

Students in the Software Development class are required to participate in this project as part of their classwork. Other GitHub users not in the class may also contribute, but may be rejected. See the [GitHub Docs: Contributing to a project](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for more guidance on contributing to a project on GitHub.

## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### CSS Files

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.

### Faculty
Sources for the information can be found in the Mount website and interviews from faculty. Each faculty member is outlined, with differences in their titles. All Professors are outlined in a list format, with information on what classes they teach as well as their areas of study; the order is as follows: Dean Dr. Christine McCauslin, Chair Dr. Jonelle Hook, Associate Professors, Assistant Professors, and Endowed Professor. The description for the faculty is on the next section, and further details are included at the bottom. Dr. Jonelle Hook (Associate Professor), Dr. Melanie Butler, and Dr. Brian Heinhold have their own pages, thus clicking on their names open up windows on further details about their profession and accomplishments.

### Computer Science major 

The **Computer Science B.S.** webpage is designed to provide prospective students with valuable information regarding the major, its academic requirements, and career prospects. We gathered credible insights from sources such as [MichiganTech.com](https://www.michigantech.com), [BestSchools.com](https://www.bestschools.com), and [Mount St. Mary's University's Computer Science Page](https://www.msmu.edu). Additionally, **Dr. Lamprecht** shared an interesting fact about a former professor who built a personal computer that Mount faculty still maintain today, adding a historical and practical perspective to the major.

**Structure and Content**

We aimed to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly webpage by including the following sections:

- **Academic Requirements**: Clear guidelines on the courses and skills needed to complete the major.
- **Career Prospects**: A focus on potential job opportunities and career pathways after graduation.
- **Personal Insights**: We shared our experiences as current computer science students, offering advice on strategies for success and expectations in the program.

**Layout and Design**

We implemented the following structure in our webpage:

- **HTML Structure**: We used HTML to organize content effectively. Key sections are introduced using header tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) to define topics clearly. Paragraph tags (`<p>`) were used to display the researched content. Horizontal rule tags (`<hr>`) help separate sections for clarity and easy navigation.

- **CSS Styling**: The webpage was styled with a **blue and pink color scheme**, selected to convey the complexity and sophistication of the Computer Science field. We linked an external CSS stylesheet in the `<head>` section of the HTML file, pulling styles from the central repository for consistent design. This color palette was intended to highlight important topics while maintaining a professional aesthetic.

**Functionality and User Experience**

Our layout is intentionally minimalistic, focused on keeping the user experience simple and direct. The design avoids unnecessary complexity while emphasizing the most relevant information. Additionally, we included **hyperlinks** to reputable external sources, offering users the opportunity to access further details on the topics covered.

**Key Takeaways**

- We structured the content to be easily navigable and visually appealing.
- The design balances professional aesthetics with user-friendly navigation.
- External sources are cited properly, with hyperlinks included for further exploration.

### Data Science major

Our page is about the Data Science major here at Mount St. Mary's University. Our information was gathered from the university's catalog of majors, specifically the section on Data Science itself. This information was used to describe what the major itself is about and how it serves the student population and/or anyone that is interested in taking the major. We used most, if not all, of the information about the major that was offered by the university to put together our specific page and provide a detailed look into what the Data Science major has to offer here at the Mount.

The initial "Who oversees the Data Science program" section, includes information such as who teaches what classes and who heads the major, such as the dean and other administrators. This information was gathered from the Department of Math and CS page offered by the university.

"Who participates in Data Science Courses" includes the types of students that take the courses. These include data science majors, CS majors, and math majors, as outlined in this section of the page.

"What should one expect" from a Data Science course outlines what content the courses are about and includes different examples of the course workloads.

In order to outline data science post-college, the "What to expect after graduating as a Data Science major" section is next to show what can be done with the major. Applying a major after graduating from the university is one of the most important aspects.

"Notable Facts" concludes the Data Science page with a few other notes about the major.

All of these individual sections are followed with directions to sources.

### Cybersecurity Major 

The purpose of the activity and who participates in the major were included in the page as one paragraph outlining why a student should major in Cybersecurity, especially since people who want to learn these skills will be the people who major in Cybersecurity. The course catalog was incorporated as a hyperlink in the Resources section at the bottom of the page to give people a way to learn more about the major. Information on how to major in Cybersecurity was included as a brief paragraph. Information on who oversees the major was included by advising students to reach out to the department if interested in majoring in Cybersecurity or learning more about it. Regarding suggestions for optional features, these were excluded from the page as they were not necessary for the assignment. Most of the information was included on the page because it is relevant to what a prospective student would most need/want to know. Information about events related to the Cybersecurity major was included in our page so that prospective students would have a quick and easy overview of what credit hours they would need. The notable facts section was also included for the same reason as before, prospective students might like to know how devoted our cybersecurity department is to providing an excellent education. Prospective students might also like to know about where alumnus that have achieved the cybersecurity major from the Mount might end up. It was important to include that the Mount offers resources to connect with many cybersecurity-related positions. Specific courses necessary for the major were also included as bullets so students can see what kind of courses the major will teach.

We chose to style the page according to the index.html file provided and arranged the sections by what a prospective student might want to see first. Notable facts appear first to spark an initial interest, then students are provided with information regarding the major’s purpose, what skills it will provide students, career paths for where this major can lead, and details and resources for students to be informed. We also grouped the larger sections via horizonal bars so that all the information based on the Mount’s Cybersecurity page can reference that one single source at the end of the section with a hyperlink. 

Interactions with our page include all the features of the Home page as well as various hyperlinks to resources for prospective students to learn more.

### Mathematics major

**Process**
We gathered our information from two sources, the first being the Overview for the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (https://catalog.msmary.edu/content.php?catoid=14&navoid=593), and the second being the page giving information about the various classes a Mathematics major may expect to take throughout their years at the university (https://catalog.msmary.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=14&poid=1203&returnto=593). We decided that all the information we included in our site was important for someone looking to learn about the major to know. For the styling of our page we decided that we would present our information in a question and answer format. We started by asking an important question to give context about the major, then answering it in an informative manner so the reader learns all they need to know.

### Double Majors
The double major page is a list of the double major options available to students. Most of the information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Clubs and organizations were gathered from the Mount's [P.E.A.K. page](https://msmary.presence.io/).  

The page was written using the HTML and CSS files included in the repository provided by Dr. Lamprecht. Therefore, the general styling and formatting of the page is consistent with the rest of the pages in the repository.   

In order to maintain symplicity in the design and formatting, the page is divided into titled sections. Most of the information on the page are displayed in bulletted lists. Captions provide the sources from which the information was gathered.

**Page Contents**
* Overview of the double major and options available to students in the CS and Math departments.
* Program Oversight
* Benefits of a double major
* How to declare a double major
* Related activities and events 
* Considerations for students considering a double major  

**Page Limitations**

Because this page covers the double major options available to students in the CS and Math departments, it is not a comprehensive list of all double major options available to students at the Mount. Furthermore, the page does not include in depth information on the requirements for a double major, as that information is available in the [Mount's Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php).  

However, in the future, the page may be expanded to include options and examples on the requirements and graduation pathways for double majors in the CS and Math departments. Similar to how the [Computer Science major page](https://github.com/Mount-St-Marys-University/Math-CS-Department/blob/main/Computer%20Science%20Major.md) includes information on the requirements for the major.  

Furthermore, more interactivity on the page may be added in the future. For example, a dropdown menu that allows users to select a double major option and see the requirements for that option. This would allow users to see the requirements for a double major without having to navigate to a separate page, making the page more interactive and user-friendly.  

The inclusion of images and/or diagrams may also be considered to enhance the visual appeal and understanding of the page.

### Women in Computing 

**How Information Was Gathered** 

The first parts of the information were gathered from the ‘Celebrating IEB at the Mount’ page on the main Mount website. The information was in the ‘Organization and Clubs that Celebrate Diversity’ section which had a dropdown menu with a selection of different organizations, one of them being WIC. The website can be found here: [Celebrating IEB at the Mount] (https://msmary.edu/about/inclusive-excellence-and-belonging/celebrating-ieb-at-the-mount.html). 

The second part of the information was gathered from an interview with Ruth Lamprecht, Ph.D (Dr. L). In the Interview, Dr. L was asked a series of questions regarding Women in Computing as she currently oversees the organization. She was asked about the purpose of WIC, the participants and events relating to the organization, and some facts. 

**How and Why information was included**

All of the information researched was incorporated into the page due to the fact that there wasn’t much information to go off of. We inserted information based upon certain questions: 

	* What is the purpose of this activity? 
	* Who participates in this activity?
	* What are some notable facts about the activity?
	* What else should students know when considering their participation in the activity?
	* Who oversees its organization?
	* How does a student join the activity?
	* What happens at an event related to the activity? 

Some answers to the questions overlapped and thus were merged together to consolidate and reduce the reiteration of points that were already discussed. We also have links to our sources and other related websites.

**Styling and Display** 

We took styling from the home (index) page provided and applied it to our own website. We then inserted in the information we collected.

### Cyber Defense Club

**Information included:**

* Purpose of activity
* Oversight of organization
* Target participant audience
* Instructions to join
* Event activities
* Notable facts
* Additional information
* Official website / Instagram

**Documentation**

Brady Mills was responsible for structuring the original HTML document, while Kaylib Sease, focused on integrating the CSS. The project began as a barebones with simple headers and paragraphs that included the information that was collected during the research period. It was further divided up into sections to enable to use of a navigation bar once implemented. The code for the buttons and navigation bars were added after the initial rough draft. 

The only information that was not included was the names of the officers, as we could not obtain proper written permission for their usage. Everything else was listed within the project requirements and was relevant to the organization of topic.

The information was gathered from the faculty member who helps to manage the organization and frequently participates in its event. Contact was made through email, and as an extension he collected information on our behalf from the collective members of the CDC. 

**Directions for Updates**

Everything that is necessary should be included within the file. Each section is labeled with an ID to make for easy understanding. If it becomes necessary to update the image, or icon, be sure to have the path to the image file correct, or in the same folder. The "middleSmall" option within the repository's css was used as to not take up the whole screen. If the website needs to be updated with new information, please contact the current organization faculty advisor or student officers.

### Women In STEM
This specific subpage is about the Women in STEM Program presented at Mount St. Mary's University. This subpage provides various information about the program, such as the program's purpose, overseers, participation, how to join, what a typical Women In STEM activity consists of, and other facts about the program.

The Women in STEM (WSTEM) club is dedicated to empowering young women to explore and succeed in science, technology, engineering, and math. It provides a supportive environment where members can grow both personally and professionally through mentorship, networking, and skill-building opportunities. The club is led by a faculty advisor, Dr. Rachel Hartnett, along with a student executive board that includes a president, vice presidents for different areas like mentorship and outreach, and other leadership roles. While WSTEM is primarily for young women interested in STEM careers, all students are welcome to participate and support the club’s mission. Students can join by signing up at school events such as the Block Party and Mount Mania, where they can get updates on upcoming meetings and activities.  

WSTEM hosts a variety of events designed to help members build connections and develop important skills. Mentorship events allow students to meet alumni and professionals working in STEM fields, providing insight into career paths and opportunities for networking. The club also offers workshops on resume building, research opportunities, and other professional development topics. Beyond academics and career preparation, WSTEM also organizes fun social events to help members bond and create a strong sense of community. With over 260 members, the club frequently collaborates with other organizations on campus, such as Students of Color in STEM (SOCS) and Women in Computing. WSTEM helps young women gain confidence in their abilities and prepare for future success in STEM fields.

### Mount Programming Club

The mpc.html page is the webpage dedicated to the Mount Programming Club (MPC), a club on campus that allows students to meet with one another and learn more about computer science as a community. 

**References** 

Information that is featured on the page was gathered from a variety of sources. Mainly, the information listed was referenced by Dr. Ruth Lamprecht, the club's faculty advisor. Several student participants and leaders that are active within the club also provided key details and information to further advance the webpage.

**Formating**

The page is formatted in a very structured way, allowing viewers to learn more about the opportunities and activities hosted by the club throughout the academic year in a clear format that engages interest. It discusses an overview of the program, who participates and oversees the organization, how students can get involved, what events the club hosts, some notable facts, and what students should consider before joining MPC. The styling and formatting of the page follow the [CSS Files](#css-files) documentation to show each section heading clearly, followed by paragraphs and short lists to display important information, depending on what is displayed.

### Smalltalks

Smalltalks are a colloquium series started by Dr. Portier in 2008 and have since been a staple of the Computer Science, Mathematics, and Cybersecurity departments. Despite this, there are only three places where Smalltalks are briefly mentioned, Dr. Heinold's profile in the University directory, Brian Heinold's CV, and the Cybersecurity page on the Mount's website. These are an excellent way of getting experience with public speaking and performing independent research. This webpage will act as a way to better document information related to Smalltalks than currently available methods of learning about Smalltalks.

More specifically defined, Smalltalks are 30-45 minute presentations that can be about any topic related to mathematics, computer science, or cybersecurity. These topics are researched by students and presented to anyone among students or faculty that would like to attend. This information is present in the "What is a Smalltalk" section of the webpage, and due to the limited documentation available related to Smalltalks is largely information known by word of mouth in the computer science, mathematics, and cybersecurity departments. In this section we also list several examples of Smalltalks from the past year, which was taken from a JSON of all Smalltalks given at Mount St. Mary's provided by Dr. Heinold.

In order to present a Smalltalk students need to go through a few steps. This includes proposing a topic to Dr.Heinold they would like to present, researching the topic, creating a cohesive presentation to discuss their topic, and then scheduling a time with Dr. Heinold to present in Laughlin Auditorium. Dr.Heinold is the current coordinator for the Smalltalk colloquium. He has been the coordinator since 2009 as per Dr. Heinold's CV.

On the page there are a few notable elements that should be taken into account to ensure page structure. Firstly, this webpage was created using the css and js pages provided by Dr. Lamprecht, and caution should be advised in adding additional css and js elements without express permission from her. On the left side of the page there is a navigation bar that should be updated to reflect any changes to relevant webpages for the Math & CS department website. The table containing past Smalltalks should be updated to reflect more recent Smalltalks that have been presented.Also, in the top right is a dropdown menu with links to other pages relevant to the Smalltalk colloquium, which should similarly be updated as information is added or removed from the page over time.

### Newsletter
#### What's Nu?
*The Math and CS Department’s very own newsletter!* 

**Research**

We were able to gather our research from Dr. Heinold and sift through the articles that give great examples that showcase the newsletters' purpose and importance. These articles include news about student alumnis, interviews of new professors, exciting development in the Math & CS department. We made sure to include examples of all the aspects you can find in the newsletter from the articles of 2024.

**Layout**

We thought that the best way to structure the page was to include a brief introduction to the page for visitors that haven't heard about the newsletter as well as some background information on how the newsletter came to be. Next, we made sure to include instructions on how students or staff can contribute to the newsletter if they were interested. We decided that it was important to separate this part from the rest so students could see this information right away. Next, we put examples of the articles you can find in the 2024 newsletter, followed by the footnote. 

**Sources**

* Our primary source of information is Dr. Heinold, as he manages the newsletter.

* All past articles can be accessed here: *What's Nu? 2024 (Past Articles) PDF Link (Provided by Dr. Heinold):* [PDF](https://www.brianheinold.net/whats_nu_2024.pdf)

* *(Change the year near the end of the link (ex: 2024) to access articles from years prior.)*

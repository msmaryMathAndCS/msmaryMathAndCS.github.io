        <h3>About the Major</h3>
        <p><strong>What is the purpose of this major?</strong></p>
        <p>The purpose of this major is to provide students with a solid and meaningful foundation in computer science, cybersecurity, data science, and mathematics. It aims to equip them with essential technical, analytical, and problem-solving skills, preparing them for successful careers or further graduate studies in these fields.</p>

        <p><strong>Who oversees its organization?</strong></p>
        <p>The mathematics major is overseen by the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. Curricular changes are made by faculty in the department, then approved by the department chair.</p>

        <p><strong>Who participates in the major?</strong></p>
        <p>Students enrolled in the computer science, cybersecurity, data science, and mathematics programs participate in the major. This includes students aiming to develop proficiency in these areas and prepare for professional or academic advancement.</p>

        <p><strong>How does a student join the major?</strong></p>
        <p>A student can join the major by enrolling in one of the department's programs (computer science, cybersecurity, data science, or mathematics). Students may also choose to double major in two of these programs due to the overlap in course content, making it feasible without overloading semesters.</p>

        <p><strong>What happens at an event related to the major?</strong></p>
        <p>Events related to the major might include coursework, lectures, practical sessions, and collaborative projects where students gain hands-on experience with programming, problem-solving, data analysis, and research in their respective fields. Aside from the core requirements at the Mount, the following are some of the classes required to graduate with a B.S. degree in Math: MATH 228, MATH 364, DATA 200, and MATH 496. Some of the electives include: MATH 336, MATH 332, and MATH 377. </p>

        <p><strong>What are some notable facts about the major?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The programs allow students to double major without exceeding 16 credits per semester.</li>
            <li>Students gain practical experience through programming and problem-solving including: going to COAD Hubs, presenting at SPARC, and visiting teachers in office hours.</li>
            <li>The curriculum emphasizes both theoretical foundations and real-world applications in various areas of computer science, cybersecurity, and data science.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What else should students know when considering their participation in the major?</strong></p>
        <p>Students should know that the programs are designed to develop logical reasoning, quantitative problem-solving, and communication skills. Graduates are well-prepared for professional careers and graduate-level education. Additionally, the programs offer flexibility, allowing students to double major in related fields.</p>

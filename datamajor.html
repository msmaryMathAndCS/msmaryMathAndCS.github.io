  <h3>Data Science at MSMU</h3>
  <p>Mount St. Mary's University has recently integrated a new Data Science course and major to its long list of possible majors! Added in the Fall of 2020, the course serves to either help create a bridge between the traditional curriculums of mathematics and computer science courses offered at MSMU, and as a major, it serves to help prepare graduates for employment as data science practitioners. This course helps develop key communication and ethical thinking skills, which are critical to success in Data Science. It also helps develop technical skills which are not just solely focused on data and programming, but mathematics as well, allowing students the chance to develop a fundamental grasp of a variety of foundational skills required in the Data Science field. </p>

  <h3>What goes on in a Data Science class/what should one expect?</h3>
  <p>Class assignments and goals can vary depending on what Data Science class you are taking, for example, the introductory course to Data Science, DATA 200, presents students with an overview and the goal of Data Science, it presents their methods and tools to use. One of these tools is R, which is introduced in this introductory class. The class teaches data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization via R coding. This class also touches on ethical issues surrounding data collection. Another example is DATA 210, which teaches exploratory data analysis, and this class will teach you about preparing data for analysis, and cleaning the data, as well as more data manipulation.</p>

  <h3>Notable facts</h3>
  <p>Some cool facts about the Data Science program at MSMU, aside from preparing students for the vastly changing data-fueled workplace regarding Data Science, lots of graduates in this major go on to work at some of the most important technology, scientific, medical and security companies in the world. For example, Margaret Wishart, Class of '22, who enrolled in a Data Science and Mathematics major, and graduated, went on to work and learn at Johns Hopkins University, and at Bristol Myers Squibb. A list of other important companies graduates have worked at is: Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, NSA, Johns Hopkins Advanced Physics Laboratory, Raytheon.</p>

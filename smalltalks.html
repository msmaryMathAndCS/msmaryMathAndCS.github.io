  <h3>What is a Smalltalk</h3>
  <ul>
    <p>A Smalltalk is a 30-45 minute presentation on topics related to Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Data Science, or Mathematics.</p>
    <p>These topics are researched by students and presented to anyone among students or faculty that would like to attend.</p>
    <p>This program was started by Dr. Portier in 2008 before being taken over by Dr. Heinold as the coordinator in 2009.</p>

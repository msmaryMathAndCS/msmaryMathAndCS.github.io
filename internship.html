                <p><em>- Internship at Mount's Security Operations Center (SOC)</em></p>
                <p>"During my Spring semester internship, I worked alongside the Mount's Security Operations Center (SOC) team. I conducted research to explore the integration of Machine Learning in enhancing cybersecurity operations. By utilizing ML models in SIEM and SOAR systems, I developed a strategy to improve threat detection and response. The goal was to assess the potential for Machine Learning to support SOC operations and bolster cybersecurity efforts."</p>
                <h3>Katherine Corbo</h3>
                <p><em>- Internship at National Bioforensics Analysis Center (NBFAC)</em></p>
                <p>"My internship is with the National Bioforensics Analysis Center (NBFAC). The work is centered around the annotation and classification of engineered plasmids, a fascinating portion of biology that is positively impacting modern-day science. This opportunity enabled me to experience one of the possible tech-enabled connections between the fields of computer science and biology."</p>

  <p class="caption">The Women In Stem Club is a support club for women who are majoring in a STEM related field at Mount St. Mary's University. Below, you can find more information.</p>
  <hr>
	

  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The purpose of the WSTEM club is to empower young women to pursue and excel in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through fostering a supportive community for personal and professional development, providing research for further growth, and promoting networking and mentorship opportunities both on and off campus. The club primarily focuses on developing professional skills through workshops and guest speakers, as well as having outreach opportunities to the local community.</p>
  
  <h3>Who oversees its organization?</h3>
  <p>The WSTEM club is overseen by our faculty advisor, Dr. Rachel Hartnett, and is run through the WSTEM Executive Board. The board consists of the president, three vice presidents for Volunteering and Outreach, Mentorship, and Campus Events, along with our SGA representative, secretary, and treasurer.</p>

    <hr>
    <h3>Who participates in the activity?</h3>
    <p>Any young woman who is a part of a STEM related major and intends to work in a STEM related field post-graduation. However, all students are welcome to support our undergraduate women in STEM.</p>
  
  <hr>

  <h3>How can a student join?</h3>
  <p>We hold several events throughout the year that help bring awareness of the club to the Mount community, such as the Block Party, Mount Mania, and others. During these events, we have sign-up sheets for interested potential members to add their email to our email group, where they are able to receive updates about club activities, events, and opportunities the club has throughout the academic year.</p>
  
  <hr>

  <h3>What is an example event of this club?</h3>
  <p>WSTEM events range in their purposes, depending on what event is being hosted. With mentorship opportunities, students are able to speak with alumni and members of the community about their experience working in STEM fields and form meaningful relationships through networking. In addition to the professional development related events (resume-building, REU information, etc.), the club
also hosts fun events to bring the WSTEM members together and form a tight knit community on campus.</p>
  

<hr>
<h3>What are some notable facts about the activity?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Our club currently has over 260 members.</li>
    <li>We often work in collaboration with other groups on campus like SOCS (Students of Color in STEM), Women in Computing, Women in Business, among others.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>What else should students know when considering their participation in the activity?</h3>
   <p>WSTEM supports undergraduate women in STEM majors as they find faith in themselves through their vocation in science and the values instilled in them at MSMU.</p>
